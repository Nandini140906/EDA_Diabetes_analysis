# 🩺 Diabetes Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a diabetes dataset to understand the lifestyle and medical factors contributing to diabetes.  
The notebook includes **data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insights** that can help in identifying high-risk groups and important features.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

## 📊 Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked for missing values & duplicates
   - Converted categorical values (0/1) into Yes/No for better readability
   - Standardized column names

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution of Age, BMI, Mental Health, etc.
   - Percentage of diabetics vs non-diabetics

3. **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**
   - Relation between **Age, BMI, Physical Activity** and diabetes
   - Impact of **High Blood Pressure & High Cholesterol**
   - Lifestyle factors: **Smoking, Fruit intake, Exercise**

4. **Correlation Analysis**
   -Analysis between diffrent columns woth diabetes
   - Identified strongest predictors of diabetes
   

## 🚀 Key Insights
- **Age** and **BMI** show a strong positive relation with diabetes prevalence.
- People with **High Blood Pressure (BP)** and **High Cholesterol** have significantly higher diabetes risk.
- Lack of **Physical Activity** and **Unhealthy lifestyle habits (smoking, low fruit intake)** contribute to diabetes.
- Correlation analysis indicates that **BMI, Glucose, and Physical Activity** are among the most influential features.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `Diabetes_EDA.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full analysis  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  


## 💡 Future Improvements
- Extend analysis with **Machine Learning models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict diabetes risk.
- Build an **interactive dashboard** using Streamlit for real-time diabetes risk exploration.
- **This are the ones i can upgrade further.
